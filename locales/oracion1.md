A wonderful example of the simple underlying principles of nature is the law of gravity,

law of gravity – is –> principles
gravity – part –> nature
law of gravity – explains –> gravity

law of gravity – explains –> gravity
gravity – part –> nature
law of gravity – explains –> – part –> nature

law of gravity – is –> principles
