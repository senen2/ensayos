Representation and expression → ←

The phenomenon of gravitation gave rise to the clumping of matter into galaxies and then into stars and planets, including our Earth.

The phenomenon of gravitation 

gravitation = gravity
gravity - is → phenomenon
gravitation - is → phenomenon
phenomenon ← of - gravitation

The phenomenon of gravitation gave rise to the clumping of matter 

gravity - produced → clumping of matter
(produced = give rise) verb
gravity – gave rise → clumping of matter
gravitation = gravity
gravitation – gave rise → clumping of matter
phenomenon ← of - gravitation
phenomenon ← of – gravitation – gave rise → clumping of matter

The phenomenon of gravitation gave rise to the clumping of matter into galaxies and then into stars and planets, including our Earth.

Galaxies – are → clumping of matter
clumping of matter ← into – galaxies
galaxies – contains → stars
galaxies – contains → planets
earth – is → planet
planets – in  ← Earth
(in = include)
planets – include  ← Earth
Earth = our Earth
clumping of matter ← into – galaxies, stars, planets, Earth

in the course of the physical evolution of the universe

physical evolution – process → nature
nature = universe
physical evolution – process → universe
physical evolution – of → universe

clumping of matter – while → physical evolution
clumping of matter – while → physical evolution – of → universe
